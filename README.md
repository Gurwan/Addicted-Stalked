<p> Addicted Stalker is a mobile application project aiming to counter the algorithms deregulating your dopamine to keep you trapped in your smartphone. The objective of this application is to make you undergo "electrochoques" intended to get you out of the loop through incessant and unstoppable notifications. The solution to see these notifications finally leave you alone? Regulate your consumption and live your life outside your daily video feed. Another solution: uninstall the application and accept to live a digital and aimless life. </p>
